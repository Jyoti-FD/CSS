    <h1>Universal Selectors (*)</h1>
    <p>There are different selectors in CSS that allow us to select one or more than one HTML element at a time but what makes universal selectors different <br> from all other selectors is their ability to select all the HTML elements of our page altogether. This means that any CSS style given to the universal selector will apply to all the elements of the web page. </p>
